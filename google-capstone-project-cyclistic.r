In this Project, I will be analysing the customer data of a fictional bike-share company called 'Cyclistic'. The aim of this project is to get some insights on how annual members and casual riders differ from each other. These insights will be used to understand which marketing strategy will be most effective in converting casual riders into annual members.\nFrom the next paragraph, I will be writing a report as a junior data analyst working for 'Cyclistic'.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Preliminary Report**\n## **- Understanding the business task**\nThis analysis has three key objectives.\n1. Understand how annual members and casual riders differ\n2. Examine factors that can compel casual riders towards annual memberships.\n3. Devise strategies leveraging digital media to convert casual riders into committed members.\n\nMy focus will be dedicated to the first goal, i.e., understanding the nuances that set annual members and casual riders apart.\n## **- All about the data**\nIn this section, we delve into the heart of our analysis: the Data.\n\n**Source:**\nIt is sourced from 'Motivate International Inc.' under the terms of their [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement), the dataset has been acquired from 'Amazon AWS'.\n\n**Data quality check:** \nThe dataset, available in CSV format and organized by month, stands out in terms of Reliability, Originality, Comprehensiveness, Currency, and Cited. Direct sourcing by the company ensures its trustworthiness.\n\n**Potential Bias and Privacy concern:**\nThe lack of unique customer identification in the dataset might hinder our analysis hence representing a form of bias that limits our exploration of individual customer behaviors and preferences. However, this limitation does offer the benefit of mitigating concerns about customer privacy, as personal data is not collected/provided.\n\n**Data Integrity:**\nThe dataset maintains integrity due to consistent columns with appropriate data types.\n\n**Data Sufficiency:**\nThe available data is adequate to provide a preliminary understanding of the distinctions between annual members and casual riders.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Data Cleaning**\n***NOTE: The following code is used to clean the data step by step.

Consistency Checks:\nChecks were performed to ensure data consistency and adherence to established standards.\n\n**Data Cleaning and Validation:**\n1. Handling Missing Values:\nMissing values were identified in non-relevant columns and subsequently dropped, ensuring no impact on the analysis.\n2. Data Type Standardization:\nData types were appropriately standardized for consistency.\n3. Cross-Field Validation:\nValidation ensured recorded data accuracy and logical coherence.\n4. Outlier Detection:\nNo outliers were found, indicating data within expected ranges.\n5. Pre-Data Appending Validation:\nValidation checks were conducted before appending all tables to ensure the proper alignment, coherence, and consistency of the data, guaranteeing a seamless and accurate merging process.\n6.

This new membership can have,\n  - Weekly/monthly/seasonal challenges\n  - Information on places that would be ideal for biking\n  - Slight discount on the time rented so that if u arent an annual member, it would be more expensive.\n  - Implement a slight discount on ride time for annual members, making it a more cost-effective option.\n  - Offer exclusive benefits like complimentary minutes deducted from their ride duration once they surpass a specified time of riding to incentivize casual riders to switch to an annual membership.\n- **Exclusive mobile app features for annual members:** Include a map of popular biking routes, safety tips, and real-time updates on bike availability.\n- **Flexible membership options:** Offer monthly trial plans so that riders can experience the benefits of the annual plan before commiting to an annual membership.\n- **Introduction of a fun community:** Hold annual members only events where members can come together to form a cyclistic community.","metadata":{}}]}
